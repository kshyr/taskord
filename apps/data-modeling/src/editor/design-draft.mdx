# Design draft

"Data modeling" may be a mislabeling. Purpose of this app is to take a rough-form idea of the user,
and turn it into a more structured form.

This may be done in a few ways:
- Set of questions to answer - like a form with a set of inputs with predefined types
- A set of predefined templates to choose from, with the ability to customize them

In each case, there should be a set of primitives that can be built upon. These primitives should be
able to be combined in a way that makes sense for the user. They also should be compatible with the
database data types and exports we want to support.

## Primitives

To facilitate the creation of structured data models, it's essential to define a set of primitives
that serve as the building blocks for constructing these models. These primitives should align
with common data types found in databases and provide a flexible framework for users to articulate
their project ideas effectively. Here are some proposed primitives:

- **Text/String**: A basic data type representing alphanumeric characters.
This primitive can be used to capture textual information such as names, descriptions, or titles.

- **Number/Numeric**: This primitive encompasses various numeric data types,
including integers, decimals, and floats.
It allows users to represent quantitative data such as quantities, prices, or numerical identifiers.

- **Boolean**: A primitive representing binary values,
typically denoting true or false. Users can employ this primitive
to model boolean attributes or binary choices within their data.

- **Date/Time**: This primitive covers temporal data, including dates,
times, or date-time combinations. It enables users to incorporate temporal
aspects into their data models, such as event dates, deadlines, or timestamps.

- **Enumeration/Enum**: This primitive defines a set of predefined values
from which users can select. It's useful for representing categorical data with
a limited number of options, such as status codes, categories, or types.

- **Relation/Reference**: This primitive establishes relationships between
different entities within the data model. It allows users to link related data together,
facilitating data organization and integrity.

- **Array/List**: A collection data type that holds multiple values of the same or different types.
Users can use arrays to represent lists of items, multiple choices, or collections of related data.

- **Object/Dictionary**: This primitive represents a structured collection of key-value pairs.
It's suitable for modeling complex data structures or nested attributes within the data model.

By offering these primitives, users can construct comprehensive data models that
accurately reflect their project requirements. Moreover, ensuring compatibility
with common database data types and export formats enhances
interoperability and usability across different platforms and systems.
